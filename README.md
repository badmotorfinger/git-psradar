# Git-PsRadar

A (work-in-progress) PowerShell port of [git-radar](/michaeldfallen/git-radar). A heads up display for git.

## Why

The most useful prompt I have seen for working with git repertories, I just had to have it!

With the standard PowerShell blue background

With a black background
![PowerShell Prompt 2](https://github.com/vincpa/git-psradar/raw/master/images/basic-usage-blackbackground.jpg)

## Current Feature Set

1. Automatic prompt - Once you import the `Git-PsRadar` module in to your session, the prompt will automatically change once you enter a git repository and revert back to the standard prompt when you exit.

2. Detect unstaged and staged changes. This includes all status types.

3. Coloured indicators for staged, unstaged and conflicted items.

## What's next

I'll be working on this script as time permits, but I am keen to bring across all features, especially background fetch.
